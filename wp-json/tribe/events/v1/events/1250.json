It also aims at involving research related to policy design, incentives and investment, as well as players in the value\/supply chains, to help secure positive change within farming systems.<br \/>\nThe symposium is focused on methodological aspects of FSD research and their applications in agriculture, innovation and policy design. The targeted audience is maximum 400 participants with a balance between scientific presentations, workshops (with limited presentations and more time for discussion) and stimulation of international collaboration. It looks for partnership with international groups and institutions at an early stage of the preparation of the event, while encouraging also individual participation.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"the-5th-international-symposium-for-farming-systems-design","image":false,"all_day":true,"start_date":"2015-09-07 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2015","month":"09","day":"07","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2015-09-10 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2015","month":"09","day":"10","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":null,"utc_start_date_details":{"year":"1970","month":"01","day":"01","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":null,"utc_end_date_details":{"year":"1970","month":"01","day":"01","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"","timezone_abbr":"","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"$","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"http:\/\/fsd5.european-agronomy.org","show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Conference","slug":"conference","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":31,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":15,"filter":"raw","id":31,"urls":{"self":"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/31","collection":"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}},{"name":"External","slug":"other","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":54,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":11,"filter":"raw","id":53,"urls":{"self":"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/53","collection":"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":1251,"author":"10","status":"publish","date":"2014-08-28 15:49:15","date_utc":"2014-08-28 12:49:15","modified":"2014-08-28 15:49:15","modified_utc":"2014-08-28 12:49:15","url":"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/venue\/unnamed-venue-4\/","venue":"Unnamed Venue","slug":"unnamed-venue-4","city":"Montpellier","country":"France","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Unnamed Venue","description":"","url":false,"address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","addressLocality":"Montpellier","addressCountry":"France"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"modextreme.org?id=1251","global_id_lineage":["modextreme.org?id=1251"]},"organizer":[{"id":1073,"author":"10","status":"publish","date":"2014-07-23 12:03:04","date_utc":"2014-07-23 10:03:04","modified":"2014-07-23 12:03:04","modified_utc":"2014-07-23 10:03:04","url":"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/organizer\/esa\/","organizer":"ESA","slug":"esa","website":"http:\/\/www.european-agronomy.org","json_ld":{"@type":"Person","name":"ESA","description":"","url":false,"telephone":"","email":"","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.european-agronomy.org"},"global_id":"modextreme.org?id=1073","global_id_lineage":["modextreme.org?id=1073"]}],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"The 5th International Symposium for Farming Systems Design","description":"&lt;p&gt;FSD5 is an opportunity to enlarge the collaboration with major agronomy societies in the world (Europe, USA, Australia, China, South America, Africa\u2026) as well as with scientific societies in other disciplines (IFSA, animal science, economy\u2026) or international institutions (CGIAR\u2026) or initiatives (Yield Gap and Water Productivity Atlas, AgMip, GFS\u2026) with an interest in farming systems.
