The objective was to launch an international and coordinated activity across projects and within the GRA, in order to benchmark and intercompare simulation models aiming at simulating GHG emissions and removals from arable crops and from grasslands. First results of a pilot blind test were presented. 28 modeling teams using data from 10 sites for simulation purpose are now involved.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/4\/2015\/03\/DSC_0110.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Gianni Bellocchi<\/a> made a speech on <a href=\"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/4\/2015\/03\/Comprehensive-model-evaluation_FortCollins_04-06032015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">fuzzy logic-based model evaluation<\/a>.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"ghg-emissions-from-agricultural-lands","image":false,"all_day":true,"start_date":"2015-03-02 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2015","month":"03","day":"02","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2015-03-06 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2015","month":"03","day":"06","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":null,"utc_start_date_details":{"year":"1970","month":"01","day":"01","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":null,"utc_end_date_details":{"year":"1970","month":"01","day":"01","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"","timezone_abbr":"","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"$","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"https:\/\/colloque.inra.fr\/worshop-model-intercomparison","show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":1383,"author":"10","status":"publish","date":"2015-01-20 16:59:26","date_utc":"2015-01-20 14:59:26","modified":"2015-01-20 16:59:26","modified_utc":"2015-01-20 14:59:26","url":"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/venue\/colorado-state-university-campus\/","venue":"Colorado State University campus","slug":"colorado-state-university-campus","address":"1101 Central Avenue Mall","city":"Fort-Collins","country":"United States","state":"CO","stateprovince":"CO","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Colorado State University campus","description":"","url":false,"address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"1101 Central Avenue Mall","addressLocality":"Fort-Collins","addressRegion":"CO","addressCountry":"United States"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"modextreme.org?id=1383","global_id_lineage":["modextreme.org?id=1383"]},"organizer":[{"id":1382,"author":"10","status":"publish","date":"2015-01-20 16:59:34","date_utc":"2015-01-20 14:59:34","modified":"2015-01-20 16:59:34","modified_utc":"2015-01-20 14:59:34","url":"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/organizer\/colorado-state-university\/","organizer":"Colorado State University","slug":"colorado-state-university","json_ld":{"@type":"Person","name":"Colorado State University","description":"","url":false,"telephone":"","email":"","sameAs":""},"global_id":"modextreme.org?id=1382","global_id_lineage":["modextreme.org?id=1382"]}],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"GHG emissions from agricultural lands","description":"&lt;p&gt;This workshop is organized by the Soil Carbon and Nitrogen Cycling Cross-cutting Group (C-N group) of the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse gases (GRA).
