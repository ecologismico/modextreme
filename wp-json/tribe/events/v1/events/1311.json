This will allow using the same graphical user interface to run existing and new models against the same data.<\/p>\n<p>The first prototype of the user interface, BioMA-Site, was presented in this workshop. It did not include the modelling solutions to be tested, but it allowed to start getting familiar with some of its features, which are now stable in its development. The workshop was also an opportunity to discuss details of what is the evaluation and simulation work expected by WP4 partners.<\/p>\n<p>Target participants were WP4 researchers who were directly involved in the use of the platform. Partners needed to attend with a laptop running Windows 7 or newer, 64 bits, with installed the .NET framework version 4.5.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"cordoba2015","image":false,"all_day":true,"start_date":"2015-01-28 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2015","month":"01","day":"28","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2015-01-29 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2015","month":"01","day":"29","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":null,"utc_start_date_details":{"year":"1970","month":"01","day":"01","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":null,"utc_end_date_details":{"year":"1970","month":"01","day":"01","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"","timezone_abbr":"","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"$","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":true,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"MODEXTREME","slug":"modextreme","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":30,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":19,"filter":"raw","id":30,"urls":{"self":"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/30","collection":"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}},{"name":"Workshops","slug":"workshops","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":29,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":22,"filter":"raw","id":29,"urls":{"self":"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/29","collection":"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":1304,"author":"2","status":"publish","date":"2014-12-04 13:13:21","date_utc":"2014-12-04 11:13:21","modified":"2014-12-05 12:37:21","modified_utc":"2014-12-05 10:37:21","url":"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/venue\/uco\/","venue":"Rectorado de la UCO","slug":"uco","address":"Avenida de Medina Azahara 5","city":"Cordova","country":"Spain","zip":"14005","website":"http:\/\/www.uco.es","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Rectorado de la UCO","description":"","url":false,"address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"Avenida de Medina Azahara 5","addressLocality":"Cordova","postalCode":"14005","addressCountry":"Spain"},"telephone":"","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.uco.es"},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"modextreme.org?id=1304","global_id_lineage":["modextreme.org?id=1304"]},"organizer":[{"id":1306,"author":"2","status":"publish","date":"2014-12-04 17:03:25","date_utc":"2014-12-04 15:03:25","modified":"2014-12-04 17:03:25","modified_utc":"2014-12-04 15:03:25","url":"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/organizer\/uco\/","organizer":"UCO","slug":"uco","website":"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/consortium\/uco\/","json_ld":{"@type":"Person","name":"UCO","description":"","url":false,"telephone":"","email":"","sameAs":"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/consortium\/uco\/"},"global_id":"modextreme.org?id=1306","global_id_lineage":["modextreme.org?id=1306"]}],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Training on the use of BioMA modelling solutions","description":"&lt;p&gt;An important action of MODEXTREME will be the comparative evaluation of existing modelling solutions against new ones.
