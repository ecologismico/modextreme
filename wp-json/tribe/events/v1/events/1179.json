The new climate governance regime is supposed to strengthen confidence, support implementation, maximize benefits of international cooperation, and bring all stakeholders to the realization that a new development model (low carbon, resilient) is actually emerging.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; For science, the question has progressively shifted from consolidating the scientific basis for assessing risks and options for action, to defining the form that action has to take in order to engage in a necessary transition to low-carbon and adapted economies and societies. For stakeholders, the question has shifted from reasons for action to the form action has to take.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; The scientific community, in partnerships with a variety of stakeholders, plays a major role for shaping our future under climate change, by identifying potential sustainable futures and innovations at different spatial and time scales, by designing and assessing relevant and coherent solutions, policies and measures, and therefore increasing the credibility of the Paris agreement.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; The conference is the major opportunity for scientists, stakeholders and the larger public, to take stock of existing knowledge, explore and identify innovative solutions, discuss them, and prepare for an ambitious post 2015 climate governance regime.<\/p>\n<p>Gianni Bellocchi presented &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/4\/2015\/07\/FACCE-MACSUR-Modelling-Agriculture-with-Climate-Change-for-Food-Security_.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">FACCE MACSUR: Modelling Agriculture with Climate Change for Food Security<\/a>&#8221; in the session &#8220;Modelling our agricultural future&#8221;, chaired by Alex Ruane.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"commonfuture2015","image":false,"all_day":true,"start_date":"2015-07-07 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2015","month":"07","day":"07","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2015-07-10 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2015","month":"07","day":"10","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":null,"utc_start_date_details":{"year":"1970","month":"01","day":"01","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":null,"utc_end_date_details":{"year":"1970","month":"01","day":"01","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"","timezone_abbr":"","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"$","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"http:\/\/commonfuture-paris2015.org\/","show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Conference","slug":"conference","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":31,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":15,"filter":"raw","id":31,"urls":{"self":"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/31","collection":"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}},{"name":"External","slug":"other","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":54,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":11,"filter":"raw","id":53,"urls":{"self":"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/53","collection":"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":1681,"author":"10","status":"publish","date":"2015-07-09 09:01:20","date_utc":"2015-07-09 06:01:20","modified":"2015-07-09 09:01:20","modified_utc":"2015-07-09 06:01:20","url":"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/venue\/unesco\/","venue":"UNESCO","slug":"unesco","address":"125 avenue de Suffren","city":"Paris","country":"France","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"UNESCO","description":"","url":false,"address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"125 avenue de Suffren","addressLocality":"Paris","addressCountry":"France"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"modextreme.org?id=1681","global_id_lineage":["modextreme.org?id=1681"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Our Common Future under Climate Change &#8211; International Scientific Conference","description":"&lt;p&gt;- Building on the findings of IPCC AR5 (5th assessment report), the scientific conference \u201cOur common future under climate change\u201d, taking place in Paris, Unesco, in July (7-10), 2015, presents updated knowledge and addresses key issues concerning climate change in the broader context of global change. - The main objective of COP 21, in Paris [&hellip;]&lt;\/p&gt;\\n","url":"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/event\/commonfuture2015\/","startDate":"2015-07-07T00:00:00+03:00","endDate":"2015-07-10T23:59:59+03:00","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"UNESCO","description":"","url":false,"address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"125 avenue de Suffren","addressLocality":"Paris","addressCountry":"France"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""}}}
