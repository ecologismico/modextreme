In particular, the forecasting capability of standard (currently used at the JRC) and improved (for extreme weather events) modelling solutions were\u00a0shown in a comparative fashion and discussed. The forecasting capability of hybrid solutions (based on dynamic simulation models and on agroecological indicators) was\u00a0also shown for MARS crops at EU level. Moreover, changes in model behavior (analyzed with advanced sensitivity analysis techniques under a variety of scenarios) due to the implementation of MODEXTREME impact models were\u00a0presented and discussed. In the case of rice, MODEXTREME results were\u00a0discussed in light of the results achieved within another EU-FP7 project (\u201cERMES\u201d).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Agenda of the workshop<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">10:15 &#8211;
