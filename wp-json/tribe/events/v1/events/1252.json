The increasing crop yields during the Green Revolution in the last century were brought about mostly through the application of chemical fertilisers and pesticides (and during an uncommon period of climate stability). Yield increases have slowed and may go into decline as the world runs out of sources of phosphate and fossil energy used to produce nitrate fertilisers.
