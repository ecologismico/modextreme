The students are required to write a report describing their model and its simulation of data from experiments. The course is worth 5 ECTS. The course is also present lectures on topics such as the latest IPCC report (Bindi and Porter are authors of this report), ongoing networks and activities related to crop modelling in Europe.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"course-model-oriented-field-experiments-for-climate-change-impact-assessment","image":false,"all_day":true,"start_date":"2014-11-10 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2014","month":"11","day":"10","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2014-11-13 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2014","month":"11","day":"13","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":null,"utc_start_date_details":{"year":"1970","month":"01","day":"01","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":null,"utc_end_date_details":{"year":"1970","month":"01","day":"01","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"","timezone_abbr":"","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"$","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"http:\/\/www.macsur.eu\/index.php\/eventlist\/icalrepeat.detail\/2014\/11\/11\/53\/-\/course-model-oriented-field-experiments-for-climate-change-impact-assessment","show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":1268,"author":"10","status":"publish","date":"2014-10-01 14:13:54","date_utc":"2014-10-01 11:13:54","modified":"2014-10-01 14:13:54","modified_utc":"2014-10-01 11:13:54","url":"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/venue\/university-of-florence\/","venue":"University of Florence","slug":"university-of-florence","city":"Florence","country":"Italy","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"University of Florence","description":"","url":false,"address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","addressLocality":"Florence","addressCountry":"Italy"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"modextreme.org?id=1268","global_id_lineage":["modextreme.org?id=1268"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Course: Model oriented field experiments for climate change impact assessment","description":"&lt;p&gt;The goal of the course is to allow PhD and other students to develop a crop simulation model from basic processes such as phenology, leaf area development, dry matter production and the responses of processes to environmental factors.
