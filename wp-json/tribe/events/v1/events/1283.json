The event was organized by the Soil Carbon and Nitrogen Cycling (Soil C-N) Cross-Cutting Group of the Global Research Alliance (GRA). It came after a workshop organized by the GRA Cropland Research Group on N2O emissions: \u201cExperimental databases and models of N2O emissions from croplands: do we have what is needed to explore mitigation options?\u201d (https:\/\/colloque.inra.fr\/workshop_gra_jpi_facce_eng)<\/p>\n<p>The workshop was attended by 70 participants from 15 Alliance member countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, UK, USA) and 2 non-member countries (India and Poland). It gathered scientists from various GRA Research groups (Croplands, Livestock &amp;Paddy Rice groups), projects and initiatives related to the common topic of agricultural GHG modeling. The workshop was chaired by France (Dr Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Soussana, INRA) as Co-Chair of the Soil CN group, and co-chaired by the representatives of the international co-joined projects.<\/p>\n<p>The main objective of the workshop was to launch a coordinated activity across projects and within the GRA, in order to benchmark and intercompare simulation models aiming at simulating GHG emissions and removals from arable crops and from grasslands. Prior to the workshop, a pilot blind test was coordinated by the Soil CN group, involving international modelers and experimental sites. First results were presented at the workshop.<\/p>\n<p>Gianni Bellocchi presented grassland and livestock modelling activities in MACSUR (<a href=\"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/4\/2014\/10\/MACSUR-Grassland-modelling.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">1<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/4\/2014\/10\/MACSUR-Grassland-Livestock.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2<\/a>) as well as <a href=\"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/4\/2014\/10\/Model-parameterisation-Calibration-Needs.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">principles of model calibration<\/a>.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"model-intercomparison-on-agricultural-ghg-emissions","image":false,"all_day":true,"start_date":"2014-03-19 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2014","month":"03","day":"19","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2014-03-21 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2014","month":"03","day":"21","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":null,"utc_start_date_details":{"year":"1970","month":"01","day":"01","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":null,"utc_end_date_details":{"year":"1970","month":"01","day":"01","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"","timezone_abbr":"","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"$","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"http:\/\/www.globalresearchalliance.org\/research\/soil-carbon-and-nitrogen-cycling-cross-cutting-group\/model-intercomparison-on-agricultural-ghg-emissions\/","show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":1285,"author":"10","status":"publish","date":"2014-10-28 11:51:44","date_utc":"2014-10-28 09:51:44","modified":"2014-10-28 11:51:44","modified_utc":"2014-10-28 09:51:44","url":"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/venue\/inra-headquarter-2\/","venue":"INRA headquarter","slug":"inra-headquarter-2","address":"147 rue de l'Universit\u00e9","city":"Paris","country":"France","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"INRA headquarter","description":"","url":false,"address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"147 rue de l&#039;Universit\u00e9","addressLocality":"Paris","addressCountry":"France"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"modextreme.org?id=1285","global_id_lineage":["modextreme.org?id=1285"]},"organizer":[{"id":137,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2014-01-10 20:27:15","date_utc":"2014-01-10 18:27:15","modified":"2014-01-10 20:27:15","modified_utc":"2014-01-10 18:27:15","url":"http:\/\/modextreme.org\/organizer\/inra\/","organizer":"INRA","slug":"inra","json_ld":{"@type":"Person","name":"INRA","description":"","url":false,"telephone":"","email":"","sameAs":""},"global_id":"modextreme.org?id=137","global_id_lineage":["modextreme.org?id=137"]}],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Model intercomparison on agricultural GHG emissions","description":"&lt;p&gt;The first collaborative workshop \u201cModel intercomparison on agricultural GHG emissions\u201d took place on 19-21 March 2014 at Paris INRA Center, France.
